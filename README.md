The CD4017 IC is a ten-digit decade counter. It has ten outputs that represent the digits 0 through 9. Every rising clock pulse adds one to the counter. When the counter reaches 9, the next clock pulse resets it to zero. It can be used to build a circuit for chasing LEDs. ï»¿The condenser mic initially detected the clap sound.
