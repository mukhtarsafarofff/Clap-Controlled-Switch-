The CD4017 IC is a ten-digit decade counter. It has ten outputs that represent the digits 0 through 9. Every rising clock pulse adds one to the counter. When the counter reaches 9, the next clock pulse resets it to zero. It can be used to build a circuit for chasing LEDs. ï»¿The condenser mic initially detected the clap sound. The sound is converted into an electric pulse by the condenser microphone. The electric pulse is then amplified by the BC547 transistor
