The CD4017 IC is a ten-digit decade counter. It has ten outputs that represent the digits 0 through 9. Every rising clock pulse adds one to the counter. When the counter reaches 9, the next clock pulse resets it to zero. It can be used to build a circuit for chasing LEDs. ï»¿The condenser mic initially detected the clap sound. The sound is converted into an electric pulse by the condenser microphone. The electric pulse is then amplified by the BC547 transistor. The electrical pulse is then fed to the CD4017 IC's CLK pin. The state of PIN 2 changes with each high pulse at the CLK pin. The second transistor is turned on when PIN 2 becomes HIGH. If the second transistor is turned on, the Relay is activated as well. When the condenser detects the second clap, the next high pulse is received at CLK PIN. PIN 2 changed its state (became LOW), causing the second transistor to turn off. As a result, the relay is turned off, and the load connected to it is also turned off.
